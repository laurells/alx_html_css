# HTML and CSS Basics

## Introduction
This README provides a summary of the basic concepts of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). These technologies are essential for creating and styling webpages. 

## HTML
- What is HTML: HTML is a markup language used to structure the content of a webpage. It defines the elements and tags that make up the structure of a webpage.
- How to Create an HTML Page: An HTML page is created by writing HTML code using various tags and elements to define the structure and content of the page.
- What is a Markup Language: A markup language is a system for annotating a document's structure and elements using tags.
- What is the DOM: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like structure. It allows scripts to access and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage.
- What is an Element / Tag: An element or tag in HTML represents a specific part of a webpage's structure or content. Tags are used to define and enclose elements.
- What is an Attribute: An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is defined within the opening tag of the element.
- Purpose of Each HTML Tag: HTML tags have different purposes, such as defining headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, forms, etc.

## CSS
- What is CSS: CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and visual layout of an HTML document.
- How to Add Style to an Element: CSS styles are applied to HTML elements using selectors to target specific elements and properties to define their appearance.
- What is a Class: A class is a way to group elements with similar styles. It allows you to apply styles to multiple elements by referencing the class name.
- What is a Selector: A selector is used to target specific HTML elements in CSS. It can be based on element type, class, ID, or other attributes.
- How to Compute CSS Specificity Value: CSS specificity determines which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used in a rule.
- Box Properties in CSS: Box properties such as width, height, padding, margin, and border control the dimensions and spacing of elements.

## Webpage Loading Process
The browser loads a webpage in several steps, including making a request to the server, receiving the HTML document, parsing and constructing the DOM, fetching additional resources like CSS and JavaScript, rendering the webpage, and executing scripts.

This README provides a brief summary of HTML and CSS basics, offering an overview of their key concepts and their role in creating webpages. For more detailed information and practical examples, please refer to the appropriate documentation and resources.
