# Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout model that provides a flexible and responsive way to arrange elements within a container. It offers a one-dimensional layout system, allowing you to control the alignment, distribution, and ordering of elements along either the horizontal or vertical axis.

Key Concepts:
- Flex Container: An element that becomes a flexbox parent by setting the `display` property to `flex` or `inline-flex`.
- Flex Items: The direct children of a flex container that are affected by flexbox properties.
- Flex Direction: Determines the main axis along which flex items are laid out (`row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`).
- Flex Wrap: Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or stay on a single line (`nowrap`, `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`).
- Flex Justify Content: Aligns flex items along the main axis, controlling space distribution and alignment (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`).
- Flex Align Items: Aligns flex items along the cross axis, controlling vertical alignment (`stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`).
- Flex Align Content: Aligns flex lines within the container when there is extra space on the cross axis (`stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`).
- Flex Order: Specifies the order of flex items within the container using positive or negative integers.
- Flex Grow: Defines how flex items grow to fill available space along the main axis.
- Flex Shrink: Specifies how flex items shrink when there is limited space along the main axis.
- Flex Basis: Determines the initial size of a flex item along the main axis before free space is distributed.
- Flex Flex: A shorthand property to set `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` in a single declaration.
- Flex Align Self: Overrides the alignment set by `align-items` on individual flex items.

By mastering the concepts and properties of Flexbox, you can create flexible and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Flexbox provides a powerful and intuitive way to handle the layout challenges in web development.
