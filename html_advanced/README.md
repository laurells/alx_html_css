# HTML Wireframe to Web Page

This project aims to convert an HTML wireframe into a fully functional web page. The wireframe serves as a visual design guide, and we'll use HTML to create the structure and content of the web page.

## General

### What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.

### How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
To create an HTML page from a wireframe, we'll translate the visual design into HTML code. Each section, element, and content of the wireframe will be represented using appropriate HTML tags and attributes. The overall structure and hierarchy of the wireframe will be reflected in the HTML structure.

### What is a markup language?
A markup language is a system for annotating or structuring documents to provide additional information about the content. HTML is an example of a markup language, where tags are used to mark up and structure elements within a document, indicating their purpose and relationships.

### What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure, allowing scripts like JavaScript to access, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a web page dynamically.

### What is an element/tag?
In HTML, an element or tag represents a specific part of a web page's structure or content. It is enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and consists of a tag name. Elements can be opening tags, closing tags, or self-closing tags. Opening tags indicate the beginning of an element, closing tags indicate the end, and self-closing tags represent elements that do not have any content or do not require a closing tag.

### What is an attribute?
An attribute provides additional information or properties to HTML elements. It is specified within the opening tag of an element and consists of a name-value pair. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element and are defined using the syntax `name="value"`. Examples of attributes include `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`, and `alt`.

### Purpose of each HTML tag
HTML tags serve different purposes and represent various types of elements or content. Some common HTML tags and their purposes include:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading tags for different levels of headings.
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag for paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag for creating links to other web pages or resources.
- `<img>`: Image tag for embedding images in a web page.
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Tags for creating unordered (bulleted) lists.
- `<ol>` and `<li>`: Tags for creating ordered (numbered) lists.
- `<div>`: Division tag for grouping and structuring content.
- `<span>`: Inline element for applying styles or targeting specific parts of the content.
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`: Tags for creating tables and defining table rows and cells.
- `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`: Tags for creating forms and input fields.
- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`: Tags for structuring the header, main content, and footer sections of a webpage, respectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-wireframe-to-webpage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd html-wireframe-to-webpage`

## Usage

1. Open the wireframe file provided in a design tool like Figma.
2. Analyze the wireframe and identify the different sections, elements, and content.
3. Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a text editor.
4. Translate the wireframe into HTML by representing each section, element, and content using appropriate HTML tags and attributes.
5. Structure the HTML page according to the wireframe's hierarchy, maintaining the proper indentation and organization.
6. Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the web page based on the wireframe.
